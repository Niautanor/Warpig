Copyright, well

The Programm itself belongs to me(Tim Malte Gräfje) but I don't really care what you do with it as long as you don't tell everyone you made this game(but hwo would do that anyway).

None of the Graphics in this game belong to me.
I just stole them from these Websites:
Background -> http://www.nesmaps.com/maps/SuperMarioBrothers/SuperMarioBrothersBG.html
PigSprite -> http://sdb.drshnaps.com/display.php?object=1791
RocketSprite -> http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=376197
ExplosionSprite -> http://www.luxinia.de/index.php/Tutorials/Tutorial19

cour.ttf -> the Font Courrier

Thanks for reading
